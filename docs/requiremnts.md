        Creating an online job portal/application 
        similar to Indeed or JobStreet is an ambitious 
        project. Here's an outline of the key features 
        and components you can consider implementing 
        using Django:

## *User Authentication and Profiles:*

Implement user registration and login functionality for both job seekers and employers.
Allow job seekers to create and manage their profiles with information such as education, professional qualifications, skills, work experience, etc.
Enable employers to create and manage their company profiles with details like company name, location, industry, and description.

## *Job Listings:*

Allow employers to post job listings with information such as job title, description, requirements, location, salary range, and application deadline.
Implement a search and filter functionality for job seekers to find relevant job listings based on criteria like keywords, location, industry, etc.
Display job listings with pagination and sorting options for ease of navigation.

## *Application Process:*

Provide a mechanism for job seekers to apply for jobs directly through the portal by submitting their resumes and cover letters.
Send email notifications to employers when a job seeker applies for their posted job.
Enable employers to view and manage the applications they receive, including shortlisting and contacting applicants.

## *Job Alerts and Notifications:*

Implement a feature for job seekers to set up job alerts based on their preferences, so they receive notifications when new jobs matching their criteria are posted.
Send email notifications to job seekers about new job opportunities and updates related to their applications.

## *User Interaction and Communication:*

Allow employers and job seekers to communicate within the platform, such as through a messaging system or direct contact details (email, phone) shared by the employer.
Enable employers to save and manage their favorite job seeker profiles for future reference.

## *Admin Panel:*

Create an admin panel for the site administrator to manage user accounts, job listings, and other relevant data.
Implement moderation features to review and approve job listings before they are published on the platform.

## *Responsive Design and User Experience:*

Ensure the application is responsive and optimized for various devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) to provide a seamless user experience.
Remember to thoroughly plan and design the database schema, considering the relationships between entities such as users, job listings, and applications. Additionally, prioritize security measures to protect user data and implement features like CSRF protection and user permissions.

        These are the core features of an online job 
        portal/application. You can expand on these 
        ideas and customize them to fit your specific 
        requirements and preferences.
